# startup_namer

A new Flutter application, by me.

## Getting Started

For help getting started with Flutter, view their online
[documentation](https://flutter.io/).

I'm following their [tutorial](https://flutter.io/get-started/codelab/) to get familiar with flutter and dart.

If you'd like to see what I create after I finish this up, be sure to check out my [flutter bug](https://github.com/Lexscher/flutter_bug) repo!


We use the open-source package, *english_words*, one of many from pub.dartlang.org
